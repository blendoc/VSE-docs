Blender's VSE is a great video editor but of course it's not a Swiss knife. In addition, the main focus of Blender is not on video editing but on 3D modeling. Some areas such as sound are less important in that perspective. So,  some functionality is not available or up-to-date. You'll need some extra-tools for this.

In this section, we describe some extra tools; mainly open source that you might need when editing.
