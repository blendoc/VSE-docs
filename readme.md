The Unofficial Documentation of Blender's Video Sequence Editor is structured into three sections:

1. Video Sequencer: describes the Video Sequence Editor; Blender's dedicated *tool* to handle video footage.
2. Video Editing: describes the usual *operations* in a video editing project.
3. Extra-tools: additional software (eg. ffmpeg, Python, exiftool, ... )
