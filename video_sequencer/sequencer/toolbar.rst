   The Sequencer toolbar contains two items: the Move tool and the Blade tool.

   Select/Select Box tool
      This tool is selected by default. :kbd:`LMB - Click` or :kbd:`LMB - drag` result in the standard behavior: selecting a single strip or multiple strips.
   

   Blade tool
      With this tool selected, the cursor changes to a crosshair. Clicking on any strip will create a regular (no Hold) Split at the position of the crosshair. Change back to Select/Select Box tool to get the default Sequencer behavior again.

In the future, more tools may be added to his toolbar. Some addons, for example the VSE Transform Tools make better use of this toolbar.
