Importing your footage
**********************

After setting up a central project directory with all your files (see :doc:`Creating a project directory </setup/organize/dir-structure/creating-directory-structure>`), you need to import your footage. This can be done in three ways:

- with the the `File Browser <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/file_browser.html>`_ (top-left window in the In the Video Editing workspace).
- with the shortcut key (Shift + A) or Add menu in the Sequencer timeline
- by dragging and dropping files on the sequencer timeline from the File Browser of the operating system.

These three import techniques are clearly explained in a video by `Mikeycal Meyers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zslAZxC29rk>`_.
