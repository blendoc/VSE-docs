Setup your project
******************

The proverb "A good start is half the battle", certainly applies to video editing. Setting up your project to *your* needs is key to success. After that, and only then, you should start editing and rendering.

Any non-trivial video project quickly counts a multitude and variety of files. Organizing them in a way so that they can easily be recognized and retrieved can save you considerable time later on.

Video editing is a labor-intensive job with many repetitive actions (cutting, moving, trimming, ...). Blender and the VSE can be fully customized, from the arrangement of windows on your screen to reassigning shortcut keys. Finding your specific, individual optimal workflow can take some time in the beginning but will pay off very soon.

Last but not least, the Blender VSE can be extended with built-in and external add-ons. An add-on is a kind of program, written for a very specific task that can be plugged into Blender.
