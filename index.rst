The documentation about video editing in Blender is grouped in two sections:

- Video Sequencer: describes the Video Sequence Editor; Blender's dedicated tool to handle video footage.
- Video Editing: describes a typical workflow of a video editing project.

When appropriate, links to other sections within the Blender docs are provided; for example the Timeline Editor.
