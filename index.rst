The documentation about editing video in Blender is grouped in two sections:

- Video Sequencer: describes the Video Sequence Editor; Blender's dedicated *tool* to handle video footage.
- Video Editing: describes a typical *workflow* of a video editing project.

Links to other sections within the Blender docs are provided for more general concepts; for example the Timeline Editor or File Browser.
