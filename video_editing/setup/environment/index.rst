Video editing is a labor-intensive process. During the course of a working day, you probably cut, trim, move, preview, ... strips hundreds of time. Having a customized working environment that is tailored to your needs can save you a lot of time.

Blender has a dedicated workspace environment for video editing. But, of course in the tradition of a truly open-source package, you can customize this completely. From rearranging windows to reassigning short-cut keys.

The Video Sequencer is a fairly good editor but, nevertheless, it lacks some (vital) components. An add-on is a piece of software that provides some extra functionality and that can be easily integrated with Blender. For example, sound editing is rather neglected in the VSE. Sound level monitoring, normalizing sound level, however, can easily be done in an open-source package as Audacity. So, there is an add-on to export your sound data to Audacity and importing it back.

The working environment can also be heavily extended/improved by the use of proxies. A proxy is a low-resolution video file that can take the place of a larger-resolution video file in your timeline. This way you can render faster. 

Cache is an auxiliary memory from which high-speed retrieval is possible. For example, a video clip that is stored on a (slow) hard disk, can be cached in RAM memory which is much faster but, of course, is more limited in size.
