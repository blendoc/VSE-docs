   You can limit your move of a strip by a press on the direction after pressing "g". ex. g+y for changing channel but keeping sync(horizontal position). And if you add a value after the direction the strip will move accordingly, ex. g+y+1 will move the strip one channel up without moving horizontally.
   (This behaviour is the same as in the 3d view)
