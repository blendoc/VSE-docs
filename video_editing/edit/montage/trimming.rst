Trimming
--------

Trimming means to reduce the length of a video by taking away frames from the Start or the End of the strip. As already discussed in the section on the :ref:`Time panel <time-panel>` or the :doc:`Split operation  <../splitting.rst>` this is done with the use of the Strip and Hold Offset fields.
