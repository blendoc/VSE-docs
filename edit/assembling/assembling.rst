Video editing is like editing a book chapter. Adding some text, shuffling around a few paragraphs, shortening here and there ... and so on.

Obviously, the first thing you have to do to assemble your timeline is adding strips. There are several ways to do this and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Strips can be moved in time (left to right on the X axis) or in the display stack (top to bottom on the Y axis).

Trimming is the process of removing or adding a portion of the video at its head or tail. This will result in a decrease or increase of the duration of the video.

Slicing (cutting) a video will create two sections of the video, one slice before the cut and another after the cut.

Grouping is the creating of a metastrip whereby several other strips are grouped together.
