Adding
------

We already discussed the main methods of adding footage to your timeline in :doc:`section Setup > import </setup/organize/import/import>`. The most versatile method is adding strips with the shortcut key (Shift + A) or the Add menu.

1 Using the Add method with multiple clips will place them one after the other on the timeline, starting at the position of the playhead.
2 When there are already strips at the position of the playhead, Blender will add the strips at the first free channel.
3 The location where you drop the strip is not important. Blender will insert them at the position of the playhead. If you try to drop the strip upon another strip (thinking that is will insert the strip), nothingAA will not happen.
4 There are 'only' 32 channels available for inserting strips (although you can zoom in to a far deeper level). So, in principle, you cannot add more than 32 strips at the same time position. You can however work around this limitation by using meta strips. Select a few strips and right click. Choose "Make meta strip". Shortcut = Ctrl + G. The selected strips collapse into one channel and count also as 1 channel.
5 It is not possible to insert strips before or between other strips. You can do that however within the sequencer.

For the File Browser Drag method, you need to drag the icon of the file. Trying to drag from above the text will only invoke a select operation.
