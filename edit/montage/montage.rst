Montage is the technique of assembling separate clips (video, audio, text, effects) into a coherent sequence. The importance of montage was first demonstrated by the Russian filmmaker Lev Kuleshov in the 1910s and 1920s. Famous is the Kuleshov effect: viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot in isolation (see the `Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect>`_ for a nice illustration). 

Obviously, the first thing in assembling your timeline is adding strips. There are several ways to do this and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Strips can be moved in time (left to right on the X axis) or in the display stack (top to bottom on the Y axis).

Trimming is the process of removing or adding a portion of the video at its head or tail. This will result in a decrease or increase of the duration of the video.

Slicing (cutting) a video will create two sections of the video, one slice before the cut and another after the cut.

Grouping is the creating of a meta strip whereby several other strips are grouped together.

.. Hint::
   Creating a good montage is a time consuming process. Therefore, all basic operations (add, split, trim, ...) have an associated shortcut. It pays off to learn these shortcuts, even though the same result could be obtained with the menu and/or mouse.

   The choice of the shortcuts (e.g. X for Delete) is of course inspired by the meaning of the operation but also by the fact that the shortcut must be easy to carry out with the left hand on a standard (Qwerty) keyboard. So, the preferred shortcut for Delete is not the :kbd:`Delete` key (which is on most keyboards on the right hand side) but the :kbd:`X` key.
